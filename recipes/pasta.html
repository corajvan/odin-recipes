        <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>

                <li>Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.</li>
                <li>Add some of the reserved pasta water to the sauce. Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little more pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
                <li>Garnish with parsley, if desired.</li>
