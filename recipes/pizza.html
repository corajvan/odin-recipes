        <h4>Pizza Dough Ingredients</h4>

            </ul>
        <h4>Pizza Toppings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>Cornmeal (to help the pizza dough slide on the pizza stone</li>
                <li>Tomato sauce</li>
                <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>Feta cheese</li>
                <li>Mushrooms</li>
                <li>Chopped fresh basil</li>
                <li>Black olives</li>
                <li>Pesto</li>
                <li>Pepperoni</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Making the Dough</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Proof the yeast.</strong> Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</li>
                <li><strong>Make and knead the pizza dough.</strong> Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment. Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Let the dough rise.</strong> Spread a thin layer of olive oil over the inside of a large bowl. Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1.5 hours to 24 hours.
            </ol>
        <h4>Preparing the Pizzas</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat the pizza stone (or baking sheet).</strong> Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour. If you don't have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan or a thick baking sheet; you need something that will not warp at high temperatures.
                <li><strong>Divide the dough into two balls.</strong> Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half. Form two round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours).
                <li><strong>Prepare the toppings.</strong> Prepare your desired toppings. Note that you are not going to want to load up each pizza with a lot of toppings as the crust will end up not crisp that way. About a third cup of tomato sauce and cheese will be sufficient for one pizza.</li>
                <li><strong>Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round.</strong> Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface. Starting at the center and working outwards, use your fingertips to press the dough to 1/2-inch thick. Turn and stretch the dough until it will not stretch further. Let the dough relax 5 minutes and then continue to stretch it until it reaches the desired diameter—10 to 12 inches. Treat the dough gently!</li>
                <li><strong>Brush the dough with olive oil.</strong> Use your fingertips to press down and make dents along the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil (to prevent it from getting soggy from the toppings). Let rest another 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Sprinkle the pizza peel with corn meal, put flattened dough on top.</strong> Lightly sprinkle your pizza peel (or flat baking sheet) with cornmeal. (The corn meal will act as little ball bearings to help move the pizza from the pizza peel into the oven.) Transfer the dough to the pizza peel.</li>
                <li><strong>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings.</strong>Spoon on the tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheese, and place your desired toppings on the pizza. Be careful not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, or your pizza will be soggy.</li>
                <li><strong>Sprinkle the cornmeal on pizza stone, slide pizza onto pizza stone in oven.</strong> Sprinkle some cornmeal on the baking stone in the oven (watch your hands, the oven is hot!). Gently shake the peel to see if the dough will easily slide, if not, gently lift up the edges of the pizza and add a bit more cornmeal. Slide the pizza dough onto the pizza stone in the oven.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake!</strong> Bake pizza in the 475°F oven, one at a time, until the crust is browned and the cheese is golden, about 10 to 15 minutes. If you want, toward the end of the cooking time you can sprinkle on a little more cheese.</li>
